# Developer Test

## Description
This test is for the Software Developer position at Provoke Solutions, Bellevue. Below you will find a list of requirements. It will be up to you to meet the requirements to the best of your ability. Please fork this repository. Once completed, you should submit your results as a pull request back to this repository.

## What you're building
You will be building an application from the ground up. This application is meant to help your users understand weather patterns using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/). It doesn't need to be fancy, but it should meet the basic requirements below. 

## Requirements
1) The backend application should be built using a C# framework (.Net Core, .Net Framework, etc).
1) The backend needs to fetch data from the weather API and be resilient against the weather API going down or being overloaded (pretend that the weather api is very fragile and often goes down*).
1) The frontend should be built with a modern framework (React, Angular, Razor Pages, etc).
1) The frontend needs to be able to communicate with the backend and retrieve stored results.
1) The frontend should display the results in a clear format.

## Submitting your work
Please submit your work as a pull request into this repository and include a short write-up of how you met each of the above requirements when you are done.

Thanks and good luck!


*Note: We may run your application against an API wrapper for the openweathermap API that fails 60% of the time.*
